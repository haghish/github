<h1><a href="#package-list" id="package-list">PACKAGE LIST</a></h1>
<p>This file includes a series of code for building an archive of all existing Stata packages and repositories on GitHub. The list of Stata repositories provides a valuable database for simplifying the syntax of the <code>github</code> package.</p>
<p>The task is done by carrying out a comprehensive API search on GitHub and combining the results. Executing this file may take many hours.</p>
<h2><a href="#to-the-maintainers" id="to-the-maintainers">To the maintainers</a></h2>
<p>After the first execution, you don&rsquo;t need to run the whole file again. Instead, you can go to <strong>SECTION 2: UPDATING</strong> and only update the archive, from the last date.</p>

<p>Only run this section once. later on, you can update your datasets, instead of running the whole search again, which takes a long time. In addition, the search might also overwhelm GitHub API. Make sure you add enough delay seconds</p>

        Importing-D~1 apanesar11           The following showcases various ways to
                                           import a wide range of file types into
                                           Python. The concepts covered are: importing
                                           flat files like .txt and .csv, importing
                                           more complex files (excel, matlab, SAS,
                                           Stata, HDF5), and importing data from
                                           relational databases like SQLite using
                                           SQLAlchemy.

        TheAssociat~i Raoufseyam           This project investigates the association
                                           between movie success and news coverage of
                                           the movie. We combined two Kaggle movie
                                           datasets with over 10,000 titles. After
                                           data cleaning and combining the .csv we
                                           were left with nearly 950 titles for the
                                           final regression modeling. Future users
                                           might want to implement a time-series
                                           analysis for more insightful results. This
                                           was the final project for the infamous
                                           Harvard stats course S040, and was
                                           completed in collaboration with Luis De La
                                           Vena. The final grade for this project was
                                           100/100. To run the STATA code, download
                                           the project files into the same folder,
                                           then change the directory in the .do file
                                           and execute.

        gsumStata     hedbergec            gsum calculates summary statistics for an
                                           ordinal variable where each category
                                           represents a range of a conceptually
                                           continuous variable. gsum provides the
                                           weighted N, the mean, the standard
                                           deviation, and quantiles 0.25, 0.50 (the
                                           median), and 0.75 (you can specify any set
                                           of quantiles you want). Each quantile is
                                           available as both the midpoint of the
                                           category in which the quantile falls, or as
                                           a linear interpolation of that quantile
                                           based on methods presented by Blalock
                                           (1979).

        robumetaStata hedbergec            robumeta for stata: robumeta provides a
                                           robust method for estimating standard
                                           errors in meta-regression, particularly
                                           when there are dependent effects. Dependent
                                           effects occur in two basic models: (1)
                                           correlated effects and (2) hierarchical
                                           meta-regression. In (1), the dependency
                                           arises as a result of correlated estimation
                                           errors; for example, a study collects two
                                           outcome measures on each participant and
                                           then summarizes these as two effect size
                                           measures. In (2), the dependency arises as
                                           a result of correlated parameters; for
                                           example, the same research group may
                                           publish several studies and there may be
                                           elements of these studies that are similar
                                           to one another. Importantly, the robust
                                           standard error procedure used here does not
                                           require the underlying correlation
                                           structure to be known; additionally, it
                                           works for any weights and can be used to
                                           estimate the mean effect size as well as
                                           meta-regression models. Finally, note that
                                           the procedure also can be used with
                                           independent effects, particularly when
                                           distributional assumptions might be
                                           violated.

                                           learnt many ways to import data into
                                           Python: (i) from flat files such as .txts

                                           this course, you'll extend this knowledge
                                           base by learning to import data (i) from
                                           the web and (ii) a special and essential
                                           case of this: pulling data from Application
                                           Programming Interfaces, also known as APIs,
                                           such as the Twitter streaming API, which
                                           allows us to stream real-time tweets.

        statastical~n ganeshkav~r          After completing Statistical Thinking in
                                           Python (Part 1), you have the probabilistic
                                           mindset and foundational hacker stats
                                           skills to dive into data sets and extract
                                           useful information from them. In this
                                           course, you will do just that, expanding
                                           and honing your hacker stats toolbox to
                                           perform the two key tasks in statistical
                                           inference, parameter estimation and
                                           hypothesis testing. You will work with real
                                           data sets as you learn, culminating with
                                           analysis of measurements of the beaks of
                                           the Darwin's famous finches. You will
                                           emerge from this course with new knowledge
                                           and lots of practice under your belt, ready
                                           to attack your own inference problems out
                                           in the world.

                                           Thesis. To compile it, one has to posses
                                           the specific LSMS data files. For the sake
                                           of clarity, the country specific files were
                                           merged into one for each country
                                           respectively. The econometric analysis as
                                           well as the balancing process was
                                           eventually conducted in Stata.

                                           get the opportunity to use either R or

                                           Azienda e Società, presenteremo la nostra
                                           Start Up, la A &amp; S ICT Solutions, che nasce
                                           con lo scopo di soddisfare appieno alcune
                                           esigenze presentate dal pubblico
                                           utilizzatore di app per dispositivi mobili
                                           e che al momento riteniamo non siano
                                           totalmente soddisfatte dai servizi già
                                           presenti sul mercato. In particolare
                                           opereremo nel settore della messaggistica
                                           istantanea. Il presente lavoro sarà
                                           articolato in più parti. In un primo
                                           momento saranno presentati i segni
                                           distintivi della nostra impresa, ci
                                           soffermeremo sul suo nome e sul perchè di
                                           questa scelta, indicheremo la forma
                                           giuridica e la nostra sede, illustreremo i
                                           valori principali che guideranno il nostro
                                           operare, definiremo i nostri obiettivi e
                                           chiariremo la nostra vision e la nostra
                                           mission, e, cioè, la volontà di fornire
                                           servizi di gradimento e di utilità che
                                           spingano gli utenti e i produttori ad
                                           installarle sui propri dispositivi e di
                                           proporre, sviluppare e realizzare
                                           applicazioni curate nei minimi dettagli,
                                           sia estetici che funzionali, capaci di
                                           soddisfare al meglio le esigenze del nostro
                                           target di clienti di riferimento. La
                                           descrizione dettagliata della nostra
                                           società continuerà poi con la scelta del
                                           modello organizzativo, che per noi ricadrà
                                           su quello funzionale o almeno tenderà nel
                                           corso degli anni ad un vero e proprio
                                           modello funzionale; per il momento,
                                           infatti, la nostra start up sarà
                                           costituita da due soli soci. Nella seconda
                                           parte sarà effettuata un’analisi di
                                           mercato del settore delle applicazioni.
                                           Partendo dallo studio degli utilizzatori di
                                           dispositivi mobili e dell’uso che ne
                                           fanno, verrà analizzato il costo medio che
                                           generalmente si è disposti a sostenere per
                                           l’acquisto di queste app e verranno
                                           indicati i pro e contro delle principali
                                           piattaforme utilizzate per l’immissione
                                           nel mercato delle stesse. Noi inizialmente
                                           utilizzeremo la piattaforma IOS in modo da
                                           limitare la complessità iniziale ed
                                           evitare un aggravio eccessivo dei costi. La
                                           nostra app che prende il nome di “PMax”
                                           ovvero “Personalization Max” è un
                                           servizio di messaggistica che permetterà
                                           all’utente di personalizzarne la chat e
                                           la view. Nella terza parte di questo
                                           progetto introdurremo i concetti di
                                           marketing strategico e marketing operativo
                                           in modo tale da chiarire come il nostro
                                           servizio dovrà e potrà posizionarsi sul
                                           mercato. Il marketing strategico permette
                                           di definire uno sviluppo capace di
                                           intercettare le opportunità del mercato e
                                           i bisogni insoddisfatti dei potenziali
                                           clienti; consente, quindi, di scoprire le
                                           esigenze del target di riferimento,
                                           studiarne il contesto nel quale si deve
                                           operare, prendere coscienza delle
                                           possibilità interne e decidere una strada
                                           da seguire per ottenere il risultato,
                                           attraverso l’analisi dei bisogni, la
                                           segmentazione del mercato di riferimento,
                                           l'analisi di attrattività, mercato
                                           potenziale e ciclo di vita, l’analisi di
                                           competitività, la scelta di una strategia
                                           di sviluppo. Saranno così definiti i
                                           nostri target di riferimento che
                                           risulteranno essere, appunto, tutti coloro
                                           che utilizzano apps di messaggistica per
                                           smartphone con piattaforma IOS e verrà
                                           effettuata una accurata analisi della
                                           concorrenza, attraverso la quale
                                           emergeranno i principali punti di forza e
                                           di debolezza e alcune delle caratteristiche
                                           distintive della nostra app che potrebbero
                                           portarci ad ottenere un vantaggio
                                           competitivo nei confronti di competitors
                                           come Viber, Kik messenger, Line, Wire e
                                           addirittura, nel corso del tempo, WhatsApp
                                           considerato un concorrente colosso.
                                           Personalizzazione, prezzo, sicurezza sui
                                           dati delle chat, utilizzo di tecnologie
                                           software all’avanguardia, queste le
                                           nostre parole chiave. In un ambito di più
                                           breve periodo, avvicinandoci alla
                                           “dimensione dell’azione” attraverso
                                           il marketing operativo ci soffermeremo
                                           sulle leve del marketing mix. Stabilire il
                                           prezzo di vendita di un prodotto ha
                                           un’importanza fondamentale per ogni
                                           impresa, per tale ragione uno studio
                                           accurato riguardo la politica del prezzo
                                           vedremo che ci permetterà di stabilire tre
                                           tipologie di prezzi per la nostra app a
                                           seconda dell’anno di acquisto. Oltre alla
                                           politica del prezzo è fondamentale
                                           prendere in esame una politica promozionale
                                           che ha come obiettivo non solo l’aumento
                                           delle vendite, ma anche la creazione di una
                                           migliore immagine dell’impresa e vedremo
                                           come la nostra scelta ricadrà sull'
                                           utilizzo dei social come mezzo di
                                           promozione e sul passaparola. Per quel che
                                           riguarda le nostre fonti di finanziamento
                                           abbiamo condotto delle ricerche per poter
                                           usufruire di un prestito agevolato, lo
                                           Startup Europa, che è un incentivo che
                                           supporta la nascita di start-up innovative
                                           in alcune zone del territorio italiano. Per
                                           valutare i vincoli e le opportunità della
                                           nostra app verrà effettuata l’analisi
                                           SWOT, che risulta essere uno degli
                                           strumenti più importanti che un
                                           imprenditore ha a disposizione per
                                           effettuare alcune considerazioni che si
                                           rivelano fondamentali per lo sviluppo del
                                           suo business e per effettuare la
                                           pianificazione strategica della sua
                                           attività. È stata effettuata, infine,
                                           un’analisi dei costi che porta alla
                                           realizzazione, diffusione e al mantenimento
                                           della start-up.

                                           backup, so it only works over Windows for
                                           now. backup is very useful as one of the
                                           instructions of the profile.do in which you
                                           can set which files or folders are desired
                                           to be backed up each time Stata is started.
                                           In addition, backup might be used at the
                                           beginning or ending of any do-file in order
                                           to ensure a backup of all the files
                                           developed in a project.

        dotemplate    randresca~a Install  dotemplate Creates template for do-files.
                                  9k       Two different type of template are
                                           provided. dotemplate is useful for being
                                           organized as programmer and standardize
                                           do-files among a team or group of
                                           programmers. If any of the options above is
                                           not specified, dotemplate will request for
                                           them. The user could press Enter from the

        ingegneria_~- michelepa~V          Il sistema CLOTS è stato implementato
                                           secondo la modalità di sviluppo Three
                                           Tier, che rende il sistema aperto a
                                           modifiche in quanto separa le interfacce
                                           dalle applicazioni logiche. La piattaforma
                                           è stata decomposta in vari sottosistemi,
                                           al fine di facilitare il suo design e la
                                           sua implementazione. La decomposizione si
                                           propone di minimizzare le dipendenza
                                           (coupling) fra i sottosistemi identificati
                                           e di massimizzare la coesione all’interno
                                           degli stessi. Si è deciso ,inoltre, di
                                           fare affidamento anche ad un’architettura
                                           Client/Server in quanto si adatta bene alla
                                           scelta dei design goal ed al tipo di
                                           software da sviluppare. Tale architettura
                                           facilita la progettazione e
                                           l’implementazione del sistema per come è
                                           stato richiesto dal cliente. La presenza di
                                           un server permette ad un certo numero di
                                           client di condividere tali risorse,
                                           lasciando che sia il server a gestire gli
                                           accessi ad esse. Il software client è di
                                           limitata complessità in quanto lavora solo
                                           come interfaccia verso il server, offrendo
                                           disponibilità di lettura e scrittura
                                           tramite i pulsanti operativi come
                                           “Visualizza Prodotto”, “Acquista”,
                                           ecc. Il software server, oltre alla
                                           gestione logica del sistema, utilizza tutte
                                           le tecniche di gestione degli accessi,
                                           allocazione e rilascio delle risorse,
                                           condivisione e sicurezza dei dati o delle
                                           risorse. Inerentemente al nostro sistema
                                           CLOTS, il server sarà rappresentato dal
                                           browser sul quale verrà aperto il sito del
                                           negozio, ed utilizzato il database di
                                           quest’ultimo, insieme ad un DBMS che ne
                                           permetterà l’utilizzo per modifiche ed
                                           interrogazioni. La macchina server
                                           comunicherà con i terminali client
                                           attraverso lo stesso browser utilizzato
                                           dagli utenti. Inoltre, si servirà di
                                           opportuni protocolli di trasmissione, come
                                           http o ftp, che permetteranno una corretta
                                           comunicazione con i terminali client. Il
                                           server analizza le richieste di servizio,
                                           le soddisfa e notifica infine i risultati
                                           ai rispettivi client mediante dei messaggi.

        do2screen     randresca~a Install  do2screen is a Stata package that allows the
                                  12k      user to review specific sections of a
                                           particular do-file, or set of do-files,
                                           directly in the Stata screen. do2screen has
                                           three functionalities. i) It displays the
                                           specific lines of code in which a
                                           particular variable is created, modified,
                                           or dropped during a routine. In this
                                           version of do2screen, the creation of
                                           previous variables are displayed. ii) It
                                           displays all the code in which a specific
                                           string is located and, by default, it shows
                                           the subsequent 5 lines of code. The user
                                           can change the number of subsequent lines
                                           to display. iii) It displays a specific
                                           section of the do-file by selecting the
                                           range of lines of code that are desired to
                                           be analyzed.

                                           observations with 330 variables. Given that
                                           this dataset was collected in all the 50
                                           states and US territories randomly, the
                                           results can be generalized to the entire
                                           population, however, causality cannot be
                                           infered.

        tslslogit     flynnzac             Implements a numerically stable method of
                                           estimating logistic regressions which can
                                           be useful when convergence issues are
                                           likely or when a system has to be robust to
                                           such problems arising unexpectedly. It also
                                           works when there is endogeneity as well.
                                           The estimator is based on a contraction
                                           mapping result (see included PDF for
                                           details).

                                           analysis using STATA. Stata is arguably the
                                           best software for data management and
                                           statistical analysis. This is in part
                                           because of its robust, powerful and fast
                                           features that enables researchers and
                                           analysts to conduct a wide range of
                                           activities from basic analysis to advanced
                                           analysis. More interesting is that STATA
                                           speaks english :)

                                           famous paintings, and recreate your own
                                           images in their styles! The network learns
                                           the underlying techniques of those
                                           paintings and figures out how to apply them
                                           on its own. This model was trained on the
                                           styles of famous paintings and is able to
                                           transfer those styles to other images and
                                           even videos!

        PLURIVERSOD~E PSICOLOGI~A          Il Progetto di Ricerca-Azione “ PLURIVERSO
                                           DI GENERE” , finanziato dalla Fondazione
                                           del monte di Bologna e Ravenna, si attua in
                                           tre fasi: la prima è la Formazione Docenti
                                           che si è svolta nelle Scuole
                                           dell’Infanzia, Elementare, e Media, del
                                           Comprensivo “Montanari” di Ravenna, la
                                           seconda è stata l’attuazione da parte
                                           delle Insegnanti di attività nelle classi
                                           per la consapevolezza del genere e il
                                           superamento di stereotipi che
                                           inconsapevolmente influenzano le
                                           prevaricazioni di un genere sull’altro, e
                                           infine la terza fase consiste nella
                                           restituzione pubblica mediante il Convegno.
                                           L’idea del Pluriverso è di Renzo Laporta
                                           e Giancarla Tisselli, nasce dal valore
                                           delle differenze e dal concetto
                                           psicoanalitico di “Individuazione” che
                                           incontra la pedagogia di genere. Le
                                           Psicoterapeute di Psicologia Urbana e
                                           Creativa Laura Casanova, Michela Balestra e
                                           Elisa Magnanensi, con esperienze di
                                           psicologia scolastica portano nella
                                           didattica l’idea di superare gli
                                           stereotipi e favorire la possibilità dei
                                           giovani di essere se stessi . Per fare
                                           ciò, l’esperienza dell’Associazione
                                           Femminile Maschile Plurale, che da oltre 6
                                           anni porta avanti studi sul genere, è
                                           stata fondamentale per avere strumenti di
                                           decodifica dei modelli suggeriti dai
                                           contesti tradizionali che continuano a
                                           proporre comportamenti stereotipati fondati
                                           ruoli predefiniti che non rispettano la
                                           libertà di esprimere le identità
                                           individuali. I modelli conservati dalla
                                           società patriarcale sono prevaricanti di
                                           un genere sull’altro, e ciò che limita
                                           la libertà e i diritti è violento. Il
                                           progetto “Pluriverso di genere” nasce
                                           anche al fine di limitare la violenza e
                                           all’opposto favorire la libertà di
                                           ognuno di esprimere la propria
                                           individualità. L’incontro con Lucertola
                                           Ludens i cui esperi di gioco, di
                                           antropologia culturale, di peer education e
                                           di peac education , hanno concepito
                                           modalità didattiche in cui l’insegnante
                                           è un facilitatore che favorisce il
                                           “Trarre fuori” e la valorizzazione
                                           delle differenze intese come risorse per
                                           tutti. Queste competenze si sono integrate
                                           con il modello pedagogico proposto da
                                           Silvia Leonelli del Centro Studi sul Genere
                                           e l’Educazione, dell’Università di
                                           Bologna, ripreso a partire da 3 fasi di
                                           lavoro: 1- trovare un argomento o uno

                                           “Esistono giochi da femmina e giochi da
                                           maschio, o giochi da tutti e due?”

                                           pluralizzare i modelli. 3-sentirsi liberi

                                           dai modelli predefiniti dall’esterno, per
                                           ascoltare l’interiorità e le sane spinte
                                           che realizzano le proprie qualità
                                           individuali.

        DorinoGB.IT   LombardIT            A Polignano a Mare si manifesta la perfetta
                                           congiunzione di un territorio che vede
                                           protagonisti due elementi naturali: la
                                           pietra e l’acqua. Da questa congiunzione
                                           è nata l’ispirazione per realizzare
                                           un’attività mirata a valorizzare le
                                           bellezze paesaggistiche e culturali del
                                           paese: \&quot;Dorino Gite in Barca\&quot;! L’azione
                                           del nostro gruppo intende offrire ai
                                           turisti un approccio innovativo al
                                           territorio, offrendo un servizio di guida
                                           turistica capace di animare i percorsi di
                                           visita con narrazioni in forma di racconto
                                           e con simpatiche interpretazioni dei fatti
                                           storici. La nostra vuole essere una
                                           proposta capace di proiettare il turista in
                                           un mondo immaginario, eppur reale, e
                                           consentirgli una nuova ed ammaliante
                                           percezione del territorio. L’intenzione
                                           è rendere partecipe il visitatore, al
                                           punto tale che egli possa sentirsi parte di
                                           una realtà sociale che è intrisa di
                                           storia tradizioni e leggende. La nostra
                                           mission è “solo” quella di rendere la
                                           visita al nostro territorio il più
                                           emozionante e memorabile possibile.
                                           Polignano a Mare deve restare nel cuore e
                                           nella mente di chi la vive. Noi con il
                                           nostro stile di narrazione cerchiamo e
                                           intendiamo divertire, intrattenere e,
                                           affascinando, far conoscere uno scorcio
                                           storico-culturale e paesaggistico a chi
                                           proviene da altri luoghi. “Vogliamo
                                           trasmettere e contagiare l’orgoglio di
                                           sentirsi polignanesi”. Polignano a Mare,
                                           splendida cittadina affacciata sul Mar
                                           Adriatico, è stata luogo e fonte
                                           d’ispirazione da tempi remoti. La città
                                           lascia scoprire ai visitatori beni storico
                                           artistici e naturali avvolgendoli nella
                                           magia di una terra ancora intrisa di
                                           tradizioni e antichi saperi. Polignano a
                                           Mare conserva un’anima trasparente come
                                           il suo mare, ma anche impenetrabile come la

        smart-health  arkimede             This is the repository for the Arkimede
                                           health monitor system. It uses a low cost
                                           sensor to detect temperature, pressure and
                                           PM10 in the air. It is economic, scalable,
                                           interoperable and open ;) . Let's try it!

        Analisi-e-c~i pensiamoa~e          L'Ode più celebre di Orazio, l'autore si
                                           rivolge qui ad una donna Leuconee, donna
                                           che non sappiamo se è vera o se è
                                           fittizia. Leuconee è stata tradotta con il
                                           nome di Lucia. Il Pascoli immagina Orazio e
                                           Leuconee a tavola, forse in una villa sulla
                                           costa Tirrenica, nel giorno del compleanno
                                           dell'una o dell'altra, occasione in cui era
                                           d'uso consultare gli oroscopi del maghi
                                           Galdei. I Babilonesi erano celebri per gli
                                           studi astronomici. A Roma vivevano molti
                                           Galdei, che sfruttavano la credulità e la
                                           superstizione del popolo romano. Qui Orazio
                                           parla de Carpe Diem, un concetto che ha
                                           suscitato nei critici varie teorie. Alcuni
                                           hanno visto in Orazio un invito a godere
                                           (invito epicureo). In realtà Orazio non
                                           invita gli uomini a godere di tutti i
                                           piaceri, ma la sua è una costatazione
                                           sulla fugacità della vita. Sugli uomini
                                           infatti incombe la morte per questo gli
                                           dice
                                           \&quot;cogli il giorno che stai vivendo senza perdonarti del futuro ignoto\&quot;.
                                           Il metro usato è l' asclepiadeo maggiore.

        Eventu..0     javieroso~o          Eventus ID is a system for supervised coding
                                           of event data extracted from text written
                                           in Spanish. The program is supervised as it
                                           requires human intervention for developing
                                           dictionaries used as search categories and
                                           for assessing the accuracy of the coding
                                           outcome. This software is capable of coding
                                           event data based on a system of pattern
                                           recognition that provides information on
                                           who did what to whom, when and where. The
                                           flexibility provided by two event coding
                                           algorithms and an event locator protocol
                                           fully integrated into the coding process
                                           enables Eventus ID to identify fine-grained
                                           event data at the subnational level. To the
                                           best of our knowledge, this is the first
                                           program specifically designed for
                                           processing short news summaries written in
                                           Spanish.

        Fecal-sludg~t Barbaraev~k          This repository contains (1) a costing model
                                           which has been used to estimate the total
                                           costs of emptying and transporting fecal
                                           sludge in two rural districts of
                                           Bangladesh, (2) the questionnaire, raw and
                                           processed data from a representative
                                           household survey and willingness-to-pay
                                           study carried out in the same two
                                           districts. These data and analysis have
                                           been combined to estimate the total costs,
                                           household willingness to pay, and
                                           consequent public finance requirement to
                                           safely manage feacal sludge for domestic
                                           sanitation provision in typical rural
                                           districts of Bangladesh. The results are
                                           available in a paper entitled Towards
                                           sustainable sanitation management:
                                           establishing the costs and willingness to
                                           pay in rural districts with high rates of
                                           access to latrines which is under review at
                                           PLOS ONE.

        MIPS_Single~e AntonDellua          As part of one of my classes, Computer
                                           Architecture, we worked with the
                                           implementation of a MIPS Single Cycle
                                           Processor created by my professor in
                                           Verilog. The challenge was to implement
                                           most of the MIPS instructions relying on
                                           modifying the top level file and the
                                           subsequent module files.

        Survival_An~e annasxu              The objective of this study is to identify
                                           what factors, or combination of factors,
                                           contributed to the relapse time of
                                           alcoholics. We are also interested in which
                                           of the two treatments (cognitive-behavioral
                                           or social) is superior in elongating
                                           relapse time compared to the other. We
                                           reviewed a total of 576 alcoholic patients
                                           and used a Cox PH model to analyze a range
                                           of genetic and environmental factors. We
                                           concluded that family support, prior number
                                           of alcohol treatments, type of treatment,
                                           age, and the interaction between age and
                                           prior number of treatments were significant
                                           factors that influenced relapse time.
                                           Specifically, stronger family support, more
                                           prior treatments, younger ages were
                                           associated with a higher hazard of relapse
                                           to alcoholism. We also found the treatment
                                           emphasizing cognitive behavioral therapy
                                           improved relapse time more than social
                                           therapy.

                                           the DDI file the code lines that derivate

                                           documented. -makeddi- identifies specific
